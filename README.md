## Usage ##

### Description ###
This image will install a dedicated server for the JGRPP version of OpenTTD
https://github.com/JGRennison/OpenTTD-patches

This image uses the scripts and setup from https://github.com/bateau84/openttd 

### File locations ###
This image is supplied with a user named `openttd`.  
Openttd server is run as this user and subsequently its home folder will be `/home/openttd`.  
Openttd on linux uses `.openttd` in the users homefolder to store configurations, savefiles and other miscellaneous files.  
If you want to your local files accessible to openttd server inside the container you need to mount them inside with `-v` parameter (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/ for more details on -v)


### Environment variables ###
These environment variables can be altered to change the behavior of the application inside the container.  
To set a new value to an enviroment variable use docker's `-e ` parameter (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/ for more details)  

| Env | Default | Meaning |
| --- | ------- | ------- |
| savepath | "/home/openttd" | The path to which autosave wil save |
| loadgame | `null` | load game has 4 settings. false, true, last-autosave and exit.<br>  - **false**: this will just start server and create a new game.<br>  - **true**: if true is set you also need to set savename. savename needs to be the name of the saved game file. This will load the given saved game.<br>  - **last-autosave**: This will load the last autosaved game located in <$savepath>/autosave folder.<br>  - **exit**: This will load the exit.sav file located in <$savepath>/autosave/. |
| savename | `null` | Set this when allong with `loadgame=true` to the value of your save game file-name |
| PUID | "911" | This is the ID of the user inside the container. If you mount in (-v </path/of/your/choosing>:</path/inside/container>) you would need for the user inside the container to have the same ID as your user outside (so that you can save files for example). |
| PGID | "911" | Same thing here, except Group ID. Your user has a group, and it needs to map to the same ID inside the container. |
| debug | `null` | Set debug things. see openttd for debug options |


### Networking ###
By default docker does not expose the containers on your network. This must be done manually with `-p` parameter (see [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) for more details on -p).
If your openttd config is set up to listen on port 3979 you need to map the container port to your machines network like so `-p 3979:3979` where the first reference is the host machines port and the second the container port.

### Examples ###

Run Openttd and expose the default ports.  

    docker run -d -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp bateau/openttd:latest

Run Openttd with random port assignment.  

    docker run -d -P bateau/openttd:latest

Its set up to not load any games by default (new game) and it can be run without mounting a .openttd folder.  
However, if you want to save/load your games, mounting a .openttd folder is required.

	   docker run -v /path/to/your/.openttd:/home/openttd/.openttd -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp bateau/openttd:latest

Set UID and GID of user in container to be the same as your user outside with seting env PUID and PGID.
For example

    docker run -e PUID=1000 -e PGID=1000 -v /path/to/your/.openttd:/home/openttd/.openttd -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp bateau/openttd:latest

For other save games use (/home/openttd/.openttd/save/ is appended to savename when passed to openttd command)

    docker run -e "loadgame=true" -e "savename=game.sav" -v /path/to/your/.openttd:/home/openttd/.openttd -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp bateau/openttd:latest

For example to run server and load my savename game.sav:

    docker run -d -p 3979:3979/tcp -p 3979:3979/udp -v /home/<your_username>/.openttd:/home/openttd/.openttd -e PUID=<your_userid> -e PGID=<your_groupid> -e "loadgame=true" -e "savename=game.sav" bateau/openttd:latest

### Setup ###
My recommendation is to create a folder on the host machine (/opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd) to store the files for the server in. I would then create the save and autosave folders (/opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd/save/autosave) 

	mkdir /opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd
	mkdir /opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd/save
	mkdir /opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd/save/autosave

I then create a config file in the .openttd folder containing standard config items like server name and rcon password for admin access from within the game

	cd /opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd
	nano openttd.cfg
Put the following in the cfg file
	
	[network]
	server_name = "JGR Server"
	client_name = "Server"
	rcon_password = "SomethingSecure"
You can add extra settings to the config file as per https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Archive/Manual/Settings/Openttd.cfg

I've found the easiest way to setup a world is to:
Load world in single player with settings you want to play with
Save game and copy to server
If you set the ENV 'loadgame = last-autosave' then I would save the file as autosave.sav and copy to the autosave folder, the server will then automatically load that save.

If you want to use NEWGRFs in the world then add these to the single player first, save and exit the game and then find the local copy of openttd.cfg (normally located at c:\users\username\documents\openttd). Add the section labeled [newgrf] to the config file on the server (**if you are using windows change the backslashes to forward slashes**) and then copy the newgrfs from your device to the server into the folder labeled content_download\newgrf (/opt/openttd-jgr/.openttd/content_download/newgrf)

## Kubernetes ##

Supplied some example for deploying on kubernetes cluster. "k8s_openttd.yml"
just run 

    kubectl apply openttd.yaml

and it will apply configmap with openttd.cfg, deployment and service listening on port 31979 UDP/TCP.
